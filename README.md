# MNist-TensorFlow

Convolutional Neural Network using TensorFlow for the MNIST dataset. 
This repository contains three files:

---
#### helper.py 
contains two helper functions, random_mini_batch(), that creates mini_batches from dataset during the training process; and convert_to_one_hot() that converts the target vector to one hot representation. 

---
#### mnist_with_tensorflow.py 
contains the functions to create the tensorflow cnn model. You can execute this file to see the results of the network. This file is modular, and you can change the parameters of the model. 

---
#### MNIST_with_TensorFlow.ipynb 
is the jupyter notebook of the same file. You can see the results, directly in the notebook. If GitHub has a problem loading the notebook, copy the URL into https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/.
